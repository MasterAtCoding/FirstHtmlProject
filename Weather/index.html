		Do always apply suncreen. When you feel yourself being pulled into a tornado, run towards the tornado
		so you can move faster and escape the tornado. If there's a flood go to your basement immeditately. it's really 
		safe down there because would expect you to go to high ground. In the event of an earthquake, stop, drop and roll. 
		Earthquakes are in fact weather and not geological events. Beaches are extra fun during tsunami time--make sure to go to the beach during a tsunami
